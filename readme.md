# Scribble-D

Scribble-D is a hardware project to get scribble displays on any controller not having them. The idea is a MCU supporting device. So

## History

The idea came up while using my [Behringer BCF2000](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0246) with [Reaper](https://reaper.fm). The combination is really great, but after a while it gets annoying to continuously look at the screen to see which fader is which track etc. Currently there are no scribble text options available in the market, so I decided to create my own.

## The device

Scribble-D is [MCU](https://mackie.com/products/mcu-pro-and-xt-pro-control-surfaces) compliant device, so it should work with most of the [DAW's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation). Because I personaly use Reaper with [CSI](https://github.com/malcolmgroves/reaper_csi/wiki) the device will also have an extra set of features, because CSI gives you tons of extra features.
